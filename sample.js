/**
 * A sample template file which demonstrates how to use model parameters in your template file.
 * 
 * After the generation, the .tmpl extension is removed and the file is renamed 'sample.js'.
 * Also, all the parameters written within double curly brackets are replaced with the appropriate values from the
 * template model.
 * 
 * For more information on template parameters, see http://handlebarsjs.com/ 
 * and the SAP River RDE Developer Guide.
